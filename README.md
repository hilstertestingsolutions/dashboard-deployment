# Dashboard

The HILSTER Dashboard is an interactive analytics tool for test results during development.

Fully integrated into the [HILSTER TestBench](https://docs.hilster.io/htf/latest/),
test reports can be sent automatically to the Dashboard upon conclusion of a test run.

Additionally, JUnit-XML compatible reports generated by other testing suites can also be
uploaded to allow for a comprehensive overview of the projects current test status.

It serves users both in managing and developing roles, showing the current project status
as well as changes over time.

Project requirements can be supplied to the Dashboard enabling users to see whether
requirements are already covered by tests.

For more information read the see
[full Dashboard documentation](https://docs.hilster.io/dashboard/latest/).
